            <h2>Experience & Achievements</h2>
            <p>
                I am currently pursuing my undergraduate degree in engineering at
                National Institute of Technology, Raipur. During my first semester,
                I explored core academic subjects along with co-curricular activities
                that helped in my overall development.
            </p>

            <h3>Academic & Co-curricular Highlights</h3>
            <p>
                Along with academics, I actively participate in cultural activities
                which help me maintain a balance between studies and creative expression.
